## Reat core vs react-dom
In versions 0.14 and higher, the React team split the library into two packages: React Core (react package on npm) and ReactDOM (react-dom package on npm). By doing so, the maintainers of React made it clear that React is on a path to become not just a library for the web, but a universal (sometimes called isomorphic because it can be used in different environments) library for describing UIs.
