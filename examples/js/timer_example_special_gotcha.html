We were extra careful when saying that a timer provides the capability
 to asynchronously delay the execution of a piece of code by at least a 
 certain number of milliseconds. Because of the single-threaded nature of 
 JavaScript, we can control only when the timer task is added to the queue,
  and not when itâ€™s finally executed!

<button id="myButton"></button>
<script>
  setTimeout(function timeoutHandler(){
    /*Some timeout handle code that runs for 6ms*/
  }, 10);

  setInterval(function intervalHandler() {
    /*Some interval handle code that runs for 8ms*/
  }, 10);

  const myButton = document.getElementById("myButton");
  myButton.addEventListener("click", function clickHandler(){
     /*Some click handle code that runs for 10ms*/
  });


</script>
