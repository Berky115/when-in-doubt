/*
Generators are a new feature of es6. Similar to coroutines in python, they yield control of the exectuion threat. When returned
the use can specify different behavior. As a result generators are an excellent option when dealing with async issues.

NOTE:
Calling a generator doesnâ€™t execute it.
Instead, it creates a new iterator that we can use to request
values from the generator. After a generator produces (or yields) a value,
it suspends its execution and waits for the next request. So in a way,
a generator works almost like a small program, a state machine
that moves between states.
