## Why use Webpack?

- Manage and bundle dependencies from npm modules, so you donâ€™t have to manually download files from the internet, and include them with <script> tags in HTML

- Transpile JSX into regular JavaScript while providing source maps for easier debugging
- Manage styles
- Perform hot module reloading
- Build a development web server
